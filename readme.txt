--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- */1 Readme
- */2 Basic HTML content
- */1 Basic CSS styling
- */1 Advanced feature
- */2 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    Images with alt text, headings and paragraph text, and I included multipled pages.


(b) CSS features
    I modifited margins & paddings, modified links to be the folder tabs at the top of the page for navigation, 
    and used custom fonts (not from Google).


(c) Advanced features
    I embedded an HTML5 video through the object tag, as having a fallback with the embedded tag is deprecated.
    I also leveraged selectors to make the navigation of my website appear as folder tabs.
    Additionally, I added a resume page where you can preview the resume in pdf form, while also being able to download it.

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
    In the "Potential Problems" section, I ignored a majority as they were just telling me might alt text might not describe the image correctly.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    Upwards of 24 hours, as I used the HTML and CSS Codeacademcy tutorials to study!
    I also found making use of Bootstrap for responsiveness to be difficult, though that was mostly because I
    attempted implementation late into website development.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
    I used the CodeAcademy resources listed on the 133 website, and a few google searches here and there for specific design ideas.
    Proud to say I didn't use AI at all! 

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I just talked to one classmate for assistance in understanding Bootstrap, but then I scrapped the whole usage later.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    I don't think so.
